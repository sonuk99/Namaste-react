                       *React will replace what ever is present here when react.render is executed
                       *React only affects the stuf which in div id=root, everything that we will render will render in this root
                        so React is called a library.
                        * React can work in any portion of an app(header footer,sidebar etc), it is small portion of framework.
                        * react can work in existing apps as well.
                        Diff bw framework, library?
                        Framework comes with lots of baggage with it unlike library.
